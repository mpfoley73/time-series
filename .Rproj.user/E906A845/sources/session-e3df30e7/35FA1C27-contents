# Preface {-}

These notes are based on the [Time Series with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/time-series-with-r) skill track at DataCamp and Rob Hyndman's **Forecasting: Principles and Practice** [@Hyndman2021]. I organized them into a section on working with a `tsibble` (time series tibble) (chapter \@ref(toolbox)), a section on data exploration (chapter \@ref(exporation)), and then four sections on models. 

Forecasts aren't necessarily based on time series models - you can perform a cross-sectional regression analysis of features, possibly including time-related features such as month of year (chapter \@ref(regression)). *Time series* forecasts are a specific type of forecast based, at least in part, on the assumption that future outcomes are functionally dependent upon prior outcomes. In most cases the objective of a time series forecast is to project a time series. In these cases, the forecast either decomposes a time series into trend and seasonality components (exponential smoothing models, chapter \@ref(exponential)) or describes the autocorrelation within the data (ARIMA models, chapter \@ref(arima)). There may also be cases where you include other predictor variables (dynamic models, chapter \@ref(dynamic)).

In addition to the standard packages, these notes use the `tsibble`, `feasts`, `fable`, and `tsibbledata` packages.
